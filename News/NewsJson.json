      "Description": "I am trying to push this to the limit. To do so, I will have to write 752 letters, which is a lot, I know, but I've already written 135, so you know what? I think I can do it. I just gotta write some random stuff. Did you see the new Green Day song? Here comes the shock? Sounds terrible, I know. I can just hope that their next albums comes out soon, but it probably wont. It took them 4 years for both RevRadio and Father of all motherfuckers. I just hope they can make a comeback after Father Of All. That shits just sad, fr. So yeah, boutta listen to macy's day parade. Scratch that, Waiting. Tired of Macy's Day Parade. Anyways, we're coming up on 752 letters, so I've gotta say my goodbyes now. It's been fun, now read my 200 page Article :)",
      "Text": "<span style=\"color:orange;\"><strong>Green Day</strong></span> is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist <span style=\"color:orange;\"><strong>Billie Joe Armstrong</strong></span> and bassist and backing vocalist <span style=\"color:orange;\"><strong>Mike Dirnt</strong></span>. For much of the band's career, they have been a trio with drummer <span style=\"color:orange;\"><strong>Tré Cool</strong></span>, who replaced <span style=\"color:orange;\"><strong> John Kiffmeyer</strong></span> in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1991). Touring guitarist <span style=\"color:orange;\"><strong>Jason White</strong></span> became a full-time member in 2012, but returned to his role as a touring member in 2016. Green Day was originally part of the late-'80s/early-'90s punk scene at the DIY 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut Dookie, released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day is credited alongside fellow California punk bands NOFX, Sublime, Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, and Jawbreaker with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.\n\nThough the albums Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000) did not match the success of Dookie, they were still successful with the former two reaching double platinum status while the latter achieved gold. Green Day's seventh album, a rock opera called American Idiot (2004), found popularity with a younger generation, selling six million copies in the U.S. Their next album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 and achieved the band's best chart performance. It was followed by a trilogy of albums, ¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré!, released in September, November, and December 2012, respectively. The trilogy did not perform as well as expected commercially in comparison to their previous albums largely due to lack of promotion and Armstrong entering rehab. Their twelfth studio album, Revolution Radio, was released in October 2016 and became their third to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. The band's thirteenth studio album, Father of All Motherfuckers, was released on February 7, 2020.\n\nGreen Day has sold more than 75 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[1] The group has been nominated for 20 Grammy awards and has won five of them with Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown, Record of the Year for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\", and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording.\n\nIn 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Scenic Design, and Best Lighting Design, winning the latter two. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, their first year of eligibility. Members of the band have also collaborated together on the side projects Pinhead Gunpowder, The Network, Foxboro Hot Tubs, The Longshot and The Coverups.\n\n<img src=\"/Images/NewsCoverImages/Responsive Web designs stinks!
